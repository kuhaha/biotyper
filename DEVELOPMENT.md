# scikit learn

- Feature Extraction, Feature Selection
  -  Feature extraction is very different from Feature selection: the former consists in transforming arbitrary data, such as text or images, into numerical features usable for machine learning. The latter is a machine learning technique applied on these features
- Preprocessing and Normalization
  - Utility functions and transformer classes to change raw feature vectors into a representation that is more suitable for the downstream estimators.

## Clustering
Clustering of unlabeled data can be performed with the module **sklearn.cluster**.

Each clustering algorithm comes in two variants: a class, that implements the fit method to learn the clusters on train data, and a function, that, given train data, returns an array of integer labels corresponding to the different clusters. For the class, the labels over the training data can be found in the labels_ attribute.

## Nearest Neihbors
**sklearn.neighbors** provides functionality for unsupervised and supervised neighbors-based learning methods. Unsupervised nearest neighbors is the foundation of many other learning methods, notably manifold learning and spectral clustering. Supervised neighbors-based learning comes in two flavors: classification for data with discrete labels, and regression for data with continuous labels.

The principle behind nearest neighbor methods is to find a predefined number of training samples closest in distance to the new point, and predict the label from these. The number of samples can be a user-defined constant (k-nearest neighbor learning), or vary based on the local density of points (radius-based neighbor learning). The distance can, in general, be any metric measure: standard Euclidean distance is the most common choice. Neighbors-based methods are known as non-generalizing machine learning methods, since they simply “remember” all of its training data (possibly transformed into a fast indexing structure such as a Ball Tree or KD Tree).
